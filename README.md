# PyAssist
### A python based home assistant framework

PyAssist is a small scale voice assistant that aims to simply allow uses to create their own rules and have these rules be enacted by the voice assistant.

At the moment, the recognition is based on pure string matching but the hope remains to add natural language processing to make this a more effective voice assistant.
